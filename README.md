## Overview
The NFC-Tag PCB is a custom NFC tag that can be programmed and read by NFC tools. Different types of files and links can be programmed written onto the ship, to then by read by a device with NFC reading capacbility. This PCB is on the smaller size, which allows it to be put onto a keychain.  It also lights up it LED whenever it is placed against an NFC reader.

## Antenna Design
The input capacitance of the NTAG chip is 50pF. The equation for the resonant frequency is $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$ The input frequency is 13.56 MHz. Thus the inductance of the antenna must be 2.75μH.

The actual dimensions of the antenna were determined by using the NXP Antenna Design Tool: https://community.nxp.com/t5/NFC/bd-p/nfc

The PCB was on the smaller size so it needed a smaller sized loop antenna, but with an inductance of 2.75μH.

The antenna symbol was then designed as a component.
