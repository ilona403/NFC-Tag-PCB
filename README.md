## Overview
The NFC-Tag PCB is a custom NFC tag that can be programmed and read by NFC tools. Different types of files and links can be programmed written onto the ship, to then by read by a device with NFC reading capacbility. This PCB is on the smaller size, which allows it to be put onto a keychain.  It also lights up it LED whenever it is placed against an NFC reader.

## Antenna Design
The input capacitance of the NTAG chip is 50pF. The equation for the resonant frequency is $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$
